'''
The file lab_ca.pem is almost certainly a PEM-encoded CA (Certificate Authority) certificate (or bundle of CA certificates) that your HTTP client will use to verify the TLS identity of your in-house LLM endpoint. In other words, instead of relying on the system’s default CA store, you point httpx.Client(verify="lab_ca.pem") at this file so that:

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- … -----END CERTIFICATE----- blocks inside it are one or more base64-encoded X.509 certificates

They represent the root (and possibly intermediate) CA that issued the LLM service’s server certificate
